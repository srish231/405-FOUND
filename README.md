# This technology can be used for :-
The following purposes in an inventory management system
1. Product Management
2. Vendor Management
3. Stock Management
4. Sales Tracking
5. Reporting and Analytics
# Challenges we ran into and how we overcame them
Many challenges were faced by us while creating this inventory management system. One of them being our participation in our first ever hackathon. But this was overcome by help from our peers and seniors who were always available when we had any doubt. Another challenge we faced was of completing the required task on time, properly. We were able to overcome this by co-operating with each other by dividing the tasks among ourselves and helping out each other wherever we were stuck. We also faced some technical issues which were resolved by helping each other
# Design Challenges
- Changing Demand
- Customer demand is constantly shifting. Keeping too much could result in obsolete inventory you’re unable to sell, while keeping too little could leave you unable to fulfill customer orders.
- Lack of System Optimization
- Lack of optimization is a common design problem that makes it more difficult to accurately plan and forecast future inventory needs.
- Decentralized Design
- An inventory system that stands on its own significantly increases the chances it will be inaccurate. While a decentralized design might initially be a less costly option for a small business on a tight budget, it can prove to be more costly over the long run.
- A common problem with an inventory system design is a failure to include methods for cross-referencing the locations of inventory items.
#  Future scopes of application
Inventory Management System (IMS) is targeted to the small or medium organization which doesn’t have many godown or warehouses i.e. only to those organization thathas single power of authority. Some of the scope are:
- Only one person is responsible in assigning the details or records
- It is security driven.
- Godown can be added as per the requirement.
- Future Enhancements
- Since this project was started with very little knowledge about the Inventory Management System, we came to know about the enhancement capability during the process of building it. Some of the scope we can increase for the betterment and effectiveness are listed below:
- Interactive user interface design.
- Manage Stock Go down wise.
- Use of Oracle as its database.
- Online payment system can be added.
# Our learnings
